# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


### Welcome to UniVibe!

This project is aimed to connect university students together. With UniVibe, students can meet new people through their own personal hobbies. This project uses microservice architecture, which means that the services are developed and deployed independently of each other. The microservices include, chat, hangout and communities. The chat service allows users to chat individually or chat through a group. The hangout section is where the users can manage their "hangouts". This means that when they join different date, time, place, and activity, it will all be listed in the hangout section for them to sort. Finally, in communities, users can pick what kind of activity they can join and also where they can list their own communities to host. 

### Prerequisites
